JinxCade is a user who started to make an appearance all the way back in December of 2019, and has only been found by others starting Mid 2020. Social media accounts wouldn't start existing until Late 2021.

Before <a href="https://jinxcade.venith.net">jinxcade.venith.net</a> was created on December 29 2023, a different website was made around March 2023 named <a href="https://jinxcade.neocities.org/">https://jinxcade.neocities.org/</a>, and it has a archive before I switched to the venith network <a href="https://jinxcade.venith.net/archives/jc_neocities/main.html">right here</a>.

The purpose of this project is to bring back compatibility to older devices, targeting specifically the DSi and 3DS handheld consoles, which you can find <a href="https://jinxcade.venith.net/dsi/">the specific site here</a>.
